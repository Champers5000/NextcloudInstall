# Nextcloud on Arch Linux Install Guide (tested on ARM rock64) | LEMP | NGINX | PHP 8
### This guide should also be applicable to x86 based systems
# This is a DRAFT (it is incomplete)

# Prerequisites
* Fresh install of Arch Linux
* Working internet connection
* Knowledge of command line and text editing

## 1. Setting up basic components for Arch Linux. Run everything in this section as the root user
### 1.1 Basic system setup
Make sure you are up to date
```
pacman -Syu
```

And install basic necessities
```
pacman -S sudo vim base-devel openssh
```
### 1.2 Text editor
This guide utilizes vim as the text editor, but feel free to use any text editor of your choice.
Open the file `/etc/environment`
```
vim /etc/environment
```
And add the following line 
```
EDITOR="/usr/bin/vim"
```

### 1.3 Hostname
Change the hostname to what you want your server to be called. Put that name in the `/etc/hostname` file
```
vim /etc/hostname
```

### 1.4 Generate Locale
Nextcloud requires that you have generated locales to work. I will be using `en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8`
Uncomment the locale you wish to use in the file `/etc/locale.gen`
```
vim /etc/locale.gen
```
Uncomment desired locale 
```
#en_SG ISO-8859-1
en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8
#en_US ISO-8859-1
```
And generate locale
```
locale-gen 
```

### 1.5 Set Timezone
Set the timezone of your computer. Here is an example setting it to US Central Time
```
timedatectl set-timezone America/Chicago
timedatectl set-ntp true
```
Replace `America/Chicago` with your choice of time zone. A list of available time zones can be viewed by running 
```
timedatectl list-timezones
```

### 1.6 Set a static IP 
Typically when port forwarding, you want your device to have a static IP. Let's set that here
To find your network device run 
```
ip a
```
My device name is `eth0`. This could vary. Pick the device you want to give a static IP. We will be using networkd to set the static ip, so we need to create a new file in `/etc/systemd/network/`
```
vim /etc/systemd/network/eth0.network
```
Now make the contents of the file look like this
```
[Match]
Name=eth0

[Network]
Address=192.168.1.102/24
Gateway=192.168.1.1
DNS=8.8.8.8
DNS=8.8.4.4
```
Replace `eth0` with your device name, and the ip address with your desired static IP address. 
Make sure you also configure your router settings to accomodated for a static IP (choose a static IP that is outside the DHCP pool).

Now lets make sure our change takes effect by enabling and disabling some services. Netctl will not be used anymore, so we remove it if it exists. 
```
pacman -Rns netctl
systemctl stop dhcpcd
systemctl disable dhcpcd
systemctl enable systemd-networkd
systemctl start systemd-networkd
systemctl enable sshd
``` 

### 1.7 External storage drive (optional)
If you so choose to use a external drive as your Nextcloud storage, follow these steps. 
Use `lsblk` to identify which drive you are using
```
lsblk
```
My drive showed up as /dev/sda
Use `fdisk` to wipe the drive and create a single partition.
```
fdisk /dev/sda
```
At the fdisk prompt, delete old partitions and create a new one:
```
Type g. This will clear out any partitions on the drive.
Type p to list partitions. There should be no partitions left.
Type n, 1 for the first partition on the drive,
	and then press ENTER twice to accept the default first and last sector.
Write the partition table and exit by typing w.
```
Format the partition as ext4 and mount it. Replace `/dev/sda1` with your new partition name
```
mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda1
```
Create a mount point for our new partition
```
mkdir /mnt/storage
```
To mount this drive on startup, we need the new partition's UUID. `blkid` can tell us the UUID
```
```
Copy the UUID of the storage partition you made. 
Next we  modify `/etc/fstab` to mount the drive on startup
```
vim /etc/fstab
```
And we write in this line 
```
UUID=HereUUID /mnt/storage/ ext4 defaults,noatime 0 0
```
To verify that our fstab works, we should try mounting everything in fstab
```
systemctl daemon-reload
mount -a
lsblk
```
If lsblk shows your partition properly mounted at `/mnt/storage`, you're good to go.

### 1.8 Setup a sudo user (optional)
It's dangerous to always run as root user. We can setup a sudo user to use for the rest of the guide here.  I'll name my user "ncadmin".
```
#create user with home folder
useradd -m ncadmin

#set the user password
passwd ncadmin

#add the user to the wheel group for sudo to work
usermod -aG wheel ncadmin
```
The user is now successfully created, but we need to allow members of group wheel to be sudoers.
Run the `visudo` command 
```
EDITOR=vim visudo
```
And uncomment this line
```
## Uncomment to allow members of group wheel to execute any command
%wheel ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
```

### 1.9 Reboot
Reboot your system to make sure all changes take effect
```
reboot
```

	    }

	edit /etc/nginx/nginx.conf file.

		nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf

	Add the following line in the http section so that individual Nginx config files will be loaded.

		include /etc/nginx/conf.d/*.conf;

	Reload service

		systemctl reload nginx

6. NC install PHP modules

	Install

		pacman -S php-gd

	Uncomment the following line in /etc/php/php.ini to enable the module

		nano etc/php/php.ini
		;extension=gd.so  

	Reload service

		systemctl reload php-fpm

	Now visit serverIP and create a Nextcloud admin, select data path (We recommend to set this path to extern filesystem i.ex. extern hdd), log in with database credentials we've created. here an example:

		admin account
		alf_admin1337
		really_strong_password

		Data folder
		/mnt/wddrive/nextcloud/data/

		Configure the database
   		USER (from when you setup the database user)
		PASSWD (from when you setup the database user)
		nextcloud
		localhost

	I got a timeout here. 504 bad gateway. reload page. reload the page, log in and wait...

7. Nextcloud post installation setup

	6.1 Set PHP environment variables properly

	Uncomment in /etc/php/php-fpm.d/www.conf the following lines

		nano /etc/php/php-fpm.d/www.conf

		;env[HOSTNAME] = $HOSTNAME
		;env[PATH] = /usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin
		;env[TMP] = /tmp
		;env[TMPDIR] = /tmp
		;env[TEMP] = /tmp

	Reload php-fpm service

		systemctl reload php-fpm

	6.2 HTTP header X-Frame-Options "SAMEORIGIN". (Double set header fields issue).


	In file /etc/nginx/conf.d/nextcloud.conf

		nano
		# add_header X-Content-Type-Options nosniff;
		# add_header X-Frame-Options "SAMEORIGIN";

	6.3 PHP Caching

	https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/PHP#Caching

	Install the php-apcu package.

	Add in /etc/php/php.ini

		extension=apcu.so
		apc.enabled=1
		apc.shm_size=32M
		apc.ttl=7200
		apc.enable_cli=1

	Add in /usr/share/nginx/nextcloud/config/config.php

		nano /usr/share/nginx/nextcloud/config/config.php
		'memcache.local' => '\OC\Memcache\APCu',

	Restart services

		systemctl restart php-fpm
		systemctl restart nginx

	6.4 Use CRON

	Install

		pacman -S cronie

	Add crontab entry // ATTENTION!!! vi will open as default editor

		crontab -u http -e
		*/15  *  *  *  * php -f /usr/share/nginx/nextcloud/cron.php

	Start and enable service

		systemctl start cronie.service
		systemctl enable cronie.service

	Set CRON radio button at Nextcloud Admin page

	6.5 Uploading files up to 16GB

	In /usr/share/nginx/nextcloud/.user.ini

		upload_max_filesize = 16G
		post_max_size = 16G
		memory_limit=512M
		output_buffering=0

	In /etc/php/php.ini

		post_max_size = 16G
		upload_max_filesize = 16G
		max_input_time = 3600
		max_execution_time = 3600
		output_buffering = Off
		upload_tmp_dir = /mnt/wddrive/upload_tmp_dir

	In /etc/nginx/conf.d/nextcloud.conf

		client_max_body_size 16G;

	In /etc/nginx/nginx.conf

		client_body_temp_path /mnt/wddrive/upload_tmp_dir;

	In /etc/nginx/nginx.conf add to PHP location block

		fastcgi_read_timeout 600;

	Restart services

		systemctl restart nginx
		systemctl restart php-fpm

	Create upload_tmp_dir on a place with enough free space and set write permission

		mkdir /mnt/wddrive/upload_tmp_dir
		chown http:http /mnt/wddrive/upload_tmp_dir/ -R
		
7) Dynamic DNS with spdns	
http://my5cent.spdns.de/allgemein/spdns-dynamic-dns-update-client.html	

Get a domain from 

	https://spdyn.de/	

Create a update Token (used in /etc/spdnsu.conf in following steps)

Install base-devel

	pacman -S base-devel	
	
Download update client		 

	http://my5cent.spdns.de/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/spdnsUpdater_src.tar.gz

Extract		

	tar -zxvf spdnsUpdater_src.tar.gz	
	
Compile the .c file		

	gcc spdnsUpdater.c -o spdnsu		
	
"Install on pi" 		

	mv spdnsu.conf /etc/		
	mkdir updater		
	mv spdnsu updater/		
	chmod u+x updater/spdnsu		
	chown -R alarm:alarm /home/alarm/updater/
	rm spdnsUpdater.c spdnsUpdater_src.tar.gz	
	
Edit the spdnsu.conf file	

	nano /etc/spdnsu.conf	

Example entry, replace `<Host>` with your domain, `<User>` with your spdyn user, `<Token>` with your update token

	[HOST]		
	updateHost = update.spdyn.de		
	host = <Host>		
	user = <User>		
	pwd  = <Token>		
	isToken = 1	

Test	

	./updater/spdnsu		
	cat /tmp/spdnsuIP.cnf	
	
Add spdns updater to crontab		

	crontab -u alarm -e			
	*/10 * * * * /home/alarm/updater/spdnsu
	
8) Mass data copy from external drive	
https://help.nextcloud.com/t/client-sync-issues-after-mass-copy-on-server-disk/10787	

Make sure that NC desktop client is OFF.	

Mount external drive and copy your data to the `/<nextcloud-repo>/<user>/files/directory`

	rsync -Aax /mnt/wdbackup/ /mnt/wddrive/<user>/files/	
	
Note that the files are not visible for Nextcloud at the moment. 

Change owner of the directory

	chown -R http:http /mnt/wddrive/<user>/files/<dir>	
	
Run the following command and make files visible to Nextcloud

	sudo -u http php /usr/share/nginx/nextcloud/console.php files:scan --all

Note that the Nextcloud desktop client should not resync (or transfer files) because you copied your data from destop sync folder to the Nextcloud user sync folder manually. In our test case different file systems (NTFS on desktop, EXT4 on Nextcloud) was NOT a problem.
